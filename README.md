# SignalR Hubs API for Server and .NET Client Sample

This small app tries to demo the SignalR Hubs API for Server and .NET client with a use case. It is a complete working app consisting of 3 executables. You can run in on any platform (on Mac and Linux using Mono).

This sample does not touch anything related to JavaScript Client which is definitely a wider use case for SignalR but once the core concepts are grasped, JavaScript Client API is no different.

Detailed SignalR Hubs API Guide could be found [here](http://resizesafari.com "a Safari extension")

## The Use Case

As a use case to demo, I selected a client who is registering to an event source to listen to events for a resource. This is like tapping an event source for a specific resource for the specified period of time. An example could be registering to a Stock Exchange portal for a specific company to get changing stock prices.

## Organization of Code

The app is consisting of 4 projects producing 3 executables.

Projects:

* SignalRSample.SelfHost
* SignalRSample.ClientConsole
* SignalRSample.EventGenerator
* SignalRSample.Common
